- build the full backend: Model, routes controller and service
- build out full CRUD capabilities with "RESTful" api definitions
- use proper error handling, throwing an error for any potential situations like missing params
- make the code as robust as possible

- build the frontend fully as well, using typescript so we can ensure we are working with the right structure and attributes as defined in the model 
- we should have a nice slick looking empty state div for when there are no records.
