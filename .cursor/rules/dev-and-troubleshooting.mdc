# Never start or restart processes #
- Do NOT run: `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `node server.js`, `vite`, `pm2 start`, `pm2 restart`, `pm2 reload`.
- Only observe status and view logs.
- If a service is offline, STOP and ask for permission before starting anything.

# The only allowed commands #
- Status (all):      pm2 ls
- Status (one):      pm2 describe <app>
- Recent logs:       pm2 logs <app> --lines 200 --timestamp
- Bounded follow:    timeout 20s pm2 logs <app> --lines 200 --timestamp
- One-shot tail:     pm2 logs <app> --lines 500 --nostream --timestamp
- Process metrics:   pm2 monit (read-only dashboard; don’t press keys to kill/restart)

# App names (adjust to your setup) #
- Web (Vue/Vite):    brew-vue
- API (Node/Express): brew-api

# Port/health etiquette #
- Do not probe ports by launching anything.
- If logs say “port in use”, do NOT kill processes.
- To determine health, prefer reading logs or asking the human.
